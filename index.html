    <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>
        I spend a lot of my time pursuing an active lifestyle - although I never seem to have enough time to fit in absolutely everything that I want to progress in! I completed my first triathlon in 2023 but I also love strength training at the gym and yoga.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm also a bit of a foodie and love trips to the theatre.
